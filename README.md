my third attempt at agender pronouns


|          | Subject | Object   | Possessive determiner | Possessive pronoun | Reflexive        |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Singular |  e[^0]  | e/ir[^1] |          ir           |        irs         | eself/irself[^1] |
| Plural   |  ey     | em       |          eir          |        eirs        | emselves         |

[^0]: to be pronounced as the letter E
[^1]: since there are two kinds of people out there and we accept em both
