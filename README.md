my third attempt at agender pronouns


|          | Subject | Object | Possessive determiner | Possessive pronoun | Reflexive |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Singular |    e*   |   ir   |          ir           |        irs         |  ymself   |
| Plural   |    ey   |   em   |          eir          |        eirs        |  emselves |

*to be pronounced **not** as in the letter E, but as half an "ee" sound, like the I in "it". same goes for the I in "ir"
